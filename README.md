### What I learned

This project was good to try a few things that involved layout skills. Recently, I wanted to learn more about accessibility and here the idea of having different sections and a Carousel was enough for me to give it a try. So, I started adding some basic HTML structure and using Dev Tools as a guide to check where I needed to improve the accessibility tree. The Carousel was the most challenging section for me due to the interactions that it has. I add a part of my code below for you to see how the carousel was made and the importance of semantics supported with aria attributes:

```html
<div id="carousel" aria-live="polite" class="sm:absolute md:min-w-[27.375rem]">
  <div
    class="animate-opacity-100"
    role="group"
    aria-roledescription="slide"
    aria-label="1 of 3"
  >
    <figure class="relative">
      <picture>
        <source media="(min-width: 1024px)" srcset="./assets/desktop/image-slide-1.jpg">
        <source media="(min-width: 640px)" srcset="./assets/tablet/image-slide-1.jpg">
        <img
          class="w-full aspect-auto"
          src="./assets/mobile/image-slide-1.jpg"
          alt=""
        >
      </picture>

      <figcaption class="slide-caption">
        <strong class="font-extrabold lg:text-[1.25rem]">Lean Product Roadmap</strong>
        2019 Project
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

        <!-- More slides -->
</div>
```

It is important to use `<div>`s because of the need of adding the `role="group"`. It helps assistive technologies to know which content is part of the slide. Moreover, if you were to use a `<ul>` you could introduce an issue since a Screen Reader will read it as a list of one item, in case you keep hidden the other slides. 

At the time of working with Tailwind, I wanted to know how to split common classes in a particular component and in that way, reduce the classes added into my HTML. I found out that this was possible using the components syntax. I will include this snippet in case you want to see how easy is to implement it:

```css
// Read more on https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply
@layer components {
  .list-item {
    @apply relative pt-11 pl-4;
  }
}
```

Speaking of JavaScript, I had my first time implementing a closure. It was a good opportunity to use it since the use case appeared. I wanted to avoid adding complexity or rewriting code just to toggle the direction of my carousel when the user clicked any button (Next or Previous). Additionally, this closure helped me to extend the functionality for two event listeners (mouse down and key down). You can see below the implementation:

```js
// ... Code and variables declaration

const changeCarouselSlide = (direction) => {
    return () => {
        carousel.children[currentSlide].classList.add('hidden');
        carouselBrands.children[currentSlide].classList.add('hidden');

        if (currentSlide + direction < 0) {
            currentSlide = carouselLength - 1;
        } else if (currentSlide + direction >= carouselLength) {
            currentSlide = 0;
        } else {
            currentSlide += direction; 
        }

        carousel.children[currentSlide].classList.remove('hidden');
        carouselBrands.children[currentSlide].classList.remove('hidden');
    };
};

const previousSlide = changeCarouselSlide(-1);
const nextSlide = changeCarouselSlide(1);

previousButton.addEventListener('mousedown', previousSlide);
previousButton.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => buttonKeyDown(e, previousSlide, 'button'));

nextButton.addEventListener('mousedown', nextSlide);
nextButton.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => buttonKeyDown(e, nextSlide, 'button'));
```

### Continued development

This project was helpful to understand how Tailwind is used and how comfortable I felt while using it. This framework gives you the possibility of speeding up your project. However, I didnâ€™t like to see the amount of classes added to the HTML just to apply different styles. I consider this is a good starting point to check other frameworks or tools to play with styles and decide what could be better depending on the use case.

Apart from that, I will continue caring for accessibility. I found this approach fun and interesting. I have been learning a lot of concepts and some attributes required in HTML to make it more accessible. Also, I have been using Screen reader and Dev Tools to check for issues so I can recognize a bit better how people with disabilities will navigate my site.
